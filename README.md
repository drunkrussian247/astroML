Stellar Distance Predictor - ML for Astronomical Data

🚀 Stellar Distance Predictor is a machine learning project designed to estimate the distances of stars using astronomical data from FITS files. By leveraging astrophysical parameters, this model aims to provide accurate distance predictions, assisting in stellar classification and space exploration research.

Current features and planned features:
✅ Reads and processes FITS files using astropy
❌ Extracts relevant stellar parameters
❌ Applies ML models to predict star distances
❌ Visualizes distributions and model performance
